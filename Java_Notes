# Computer :- Computer is an electronic device which is made up of Hardware and Software components,
              using which we can - Store data
                                 - Process Data
                                 - Retrive data.

# What is Hardware... ?
  - Hardware are the combination of electronic components.
  - Such as RAM, ROM, Graphic card, Motherboard, Cooling fan etc.
  - To run a software.

# What is Software... ?
  - Software is a combination of front-end, middleware and backend which acts an interface between the user and the hardware components.
  - e.g. Windows, Linux, MAC etc.

# What is Language... ?
  - Language is an medium and mode of communication between two or more entities.

# What is programming Language... ?
  - Language which is used to communicate with computer to make it perform a specific task is known as programming Language.
# Creator of Computer :- Charles Babbage 
                      - He is a Mechanical Engineer(Mathematician)
                      - He made Differential Engin in 1832
  - Ada Lovelace ---> First Programmer
#  # levels of programming language
1) Machine Level Or Low Level language
  -  The language which is directly understandable to a machine or processor.
  -  e.g. Binary language - ON, OFF
                            (0, 1)

2)  Assemblely Level Language
  -  The language which consist of pre-defined set of codewords known as mnemonics which was understandable to computer using a assembler.

# What is Assembler... ?
  - Assembler is an intermediate software which acts like an translator which is used to convert or translate
    assemblely level language into machine level language.

3) High Level Language
  - The language which is very similar to human understandable language which is easily readable, understandable and instructable by a programmer 
    to a computer is known as high level language.
  - English was choosen as the base language to make high level language.
  - High level language is converted to machine level language using software know as compiler.

# What is Compiler... ?
  - Compiler is an Intermediate software which  is used to convert high level language to machine level language.

# Platform
  - Platform is a combination of some hardware components alogn with an software components on which application can run is called platform.
  - Software are classified into 2 types according to platforms.
    i] Platform dependent sofware.
   ii] Platform Independent software.

i] Platform dependent software
  - If software are made using C, C++ are platform dependent.
  - If the software design using the specific configuration platform and if the software can run on same configuration such kind of software is know as platform dependent software.

ii] Platform Independent software
  - If a software design using the specific configuration platform and if the software can run an any configuration platform such software are known as platform independent software.
  - If is software which is made using a specific configuration platform and if that software can run on any platform such software called an independent software.
  - Software made using JAVA platform independent

# Why Software made using C language iare platform dependetn... ?
---> - When a programmer wirtes a program using C or C++ language save it with .c extension and give it to a C compiler.
     - The C compiler converts .c file into .exe file.
     - WHich contains native machine level code.
     - The native machine level code is only understandable to natvie configuration platform but not any other platform.
     - That's why C & C++ language are platform dependent.

#  WHy Java Software are platform independent... ?
---> - If a programmer writes program using Java language & save it with .java extension give it to the Java Compiler.
     - The Java Compiler converts the .java file into .class file which contains Byte Code.
     - Byte Code is an intermediate code created by Java compiler which is neither understandable to computer nor the programmer.
     - This JVM can be uderstandable to any configuration platform if those platform installed with software known as JVM.
     - Creaters of Java have design JVM for every configuration platform such that any platform which is respective JVM can convert BYTE CODE to it's respective machine level language.
     - This is how Software prove the concept of platform independent.
     - Java Software is also called Right Once Run Anywhere concept.

# JDK Architecture (Important)

# JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
 - It is an Interpreter which is used to convert byte code into machine level language line by line.
 - The JVM present inside JRE.

#  JRE(Java Runtime Environment)
 - JRE consist of JVM and Built in library files which is used to completely run the Java application.
 - JRE is present inside JDK

# JDK(Java Development Kit)
 - It is a package given by Oracel community.
 - Which consist of JRE and Development Tools, which helps us to develop as well as run the Java application.

# Steps to Create, Cimpile and Execute a Java program.
Step 01 :- To write a java program we need editiors and ide's
        - Editor               IDE
        - Notepad            Eclipse
        - Notepad++          Intellij
        - MS World           NetBeans
        - EditPlus           VS code
        - Sublime                     etc

Step 02 :- Invoke or call the Java compiler to compile the Java file.

# Work of Java Compiler
---> - Compiler checks for syntax(rules of language).
     - If the syntax is write class files are generated.
     - If the syntax is wrong class file are not generated instead it through compile time error where class files are not generated.

Step 03 :- Call the JVM
         - Which is use to execute the class file helps to run class files.

# Structure of Java Program
clsss ClassName
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {

    }
}
# Class Block 
  - Class Block contains variables, Methods(main method, initializers, Constructors etc)
  - Whatever written within class it is called class block.
  - Whatever written within method is called method block

# Syntax for print statement.
---> - system.out.println(); // To print data to next line.
     - System.out.println(); // To print data to same line.

# Basic CLT (Command Line Interface)
  - 1) dir :- To explore the directory.
  - 2) cls :- To clear the screen
  - 3) DriveName :- Shift to another diriver i.e. c:\ D: (Enter) // It wil lshift to D driver
  - 4) cd folderName :- Go to parent folder to child folder.
  - 5) cd.. :- Go one folder previous OR child to parent folder.
  - 6) cd../.. :- Go to double folder previous.
        e.g. :- c:\ program file\Java
              ---> command : cd../.. Enter
              O/P :- C:\
  - 7) mkdir ro md FolderName enter
       O/P :- Create Folder
  - 8) rd Or rmdir FolderName Enter
      O?P :- to remove folder
  - 9) check Java version :- Java -version Enter
  - 10) Check Java Compiler Version :- Javac -version Enter
  - 11) Javac ClassName.java :- To compiler the Java code.
  - 12) Java ClassNae :- To execute the Java Code

# First Program
= class program 
{
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
      System.out.println("Hello World!);
  }
}
Javac Program.java (Enter)
Java Program (Enter)
O?P :- Hello World!

HomeWork :- Introduction in Code
class Introduction
{
  {
    System.out.println("Name : Chinmay Gaikwad");
    System.out.println("College Institute : SIMMC");
    System.out.println("Branch : MCA");
    System.out.println("Age : 23");
    System.out.println("Address : Bavdhan Pune");
  }
}
