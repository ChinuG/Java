# Computer :- Computer is an electronic device which is made up of Hardware and Software components,
              using which we can - Store data
                                 - Process Data
                                 - Retrive data.

# What is Hardware... ?
  - Hardware are the combination of electronic components.
  - Such as RAM, ROM, Graphic card, Motherboard, Cooling fan etc.

                      - He is a Mechanical Engineer(Mathematician)
                      - He made Differential Engin in 1832

#  # levels of programming language
1) Machine Level Or Low Level language
  -  The language which is directly understandable to a machine or processor.
  -  e.g. Binary language - ON, OFF
                            (0, 1)

2)  Assemblely Level Language
  -  The language which consist of pre-defined set of codewords known as mnemonics which was understandable to computer using a assembler.

# What is Assembler... ?
  - Assembler is an intermediate software which acts like an translator which is used to convert or translate assemblely level language into machine level language.
